# BigO and Python Environment

## pain and suffering

Intensive learning is a painful process but the results are always fascinating. In this course, we will be stressed for 10 weeks to learn a lot of programming skills and how to use the tool python language.

## BigO 

BigO is a method to measure the complexity of any process and its run time, this is very important for any function. Knowing it will lead you to make fast and efficient programs.

## The Python Environment

There are many interpolator versions for Python, which make the work with old projects or the 3rd party packages that depend on the deferent version of the interpolator hard. to solve this you should work with a virtual environment for each project. there are a large variety o tools that help you with that, such as ***(Pyenv)*** and ***(pyenv-virtualenv)***.

There is a tool called ***(Poetry)*** which helps you manage your projectsâ€™ dependencies, separate your projects through virtual environments, and build both applications as well as libraries without headaches.

Readability is one of the major considerations for every programmer, the documentation always helps you with this. However, there are tools to help you further, such as ***(Black)***.


Typing correctness is a nightmare for any programmer. A small typo could simply damage your program. ***(Mypy)*** is one of the tools that helps you with this disaster by annotating you if any potential error could happen.

***(Pre-commit)*** is a tool that executes checks before you commit code to your repository. When those checks fail, your commit will be rejected.
