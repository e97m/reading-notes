# React 2

Review the folloing topics:

- [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

    Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

- [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

    Lists could be used in react to do alot of things. map() function could be used to traverse an array then assign the a array returned by map(). Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

- [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

    It is almost the same as forms in HTML. But HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

- [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

    Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. 

- [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

    React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

    One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.
